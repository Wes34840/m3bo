# m3bo Changelog, I guess


## 0.0.3

- tbh, this is the earliest version I pushed to github.

## 0.0.4

- Made actual pathing logic instead of having my enemies be lobotomized.
- Implemented basic ammo feature, probably missed a couple of lines of code but I'm sure they'll bite me in the ass sooner or later.
- Made a pressure plate that opens up a door.
- Updated UI Font.
- Made ammo, score and live counters for UI that kinda work.
- Player is no longer immortal and can die.
