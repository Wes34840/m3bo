  - Collectible keycard
  - End screen
  - Pause screen

- Changes
  - Fucked around with camera so it can be fixed at certain points, probably won't use aside from building exploration
  - Stopped trying to be as professional in changelogs
  - Made player able to jump higher
  - Better floating platform

- the amount of headaches and time I put into this probably qualifies it to be a version with a different decimal number

## 0.0.9

- enemies now need line of sight or the player to be close enough to wake up
- movement is now no longer dependant on framerate because my dumb ass found out rb.velocity was already framerate indepenant and Time.deltaTime was the thing that was causing issues (only took me like a month)

## 0.0.8

- Added like 5 extra enemies to the map
- Changed volume so the enemies don't give you tinnitus

## 0.0.7

- Added sounds to the following things:
  - Player
    - Shooting
    - Having an empty magazine

  - Enemy
    - Attacking
    - Taking damage
    - Dying
- Added background music to main menu and level 1

## 0.0.6

- You can no longer kickflip the pressure plate, sorry safwan

## 0.0.5

- Fixed score so you don't get hundreds of thousands of points when killing one enemy
- Added clicking sound when your gun is empty
- Also changed this to have latest on the top for readability

## 0.0.4

- Made actual pathing logic instead of having my enemies be lobotomized.
- Implemented basic ammo feature, probably missed a couple of lines of code but I'm sure they'll bite me in the ass sooner or later.
- Made a pressure plate that opens up a door.
- Updated UI Font.
- Made ammo, score and live counters for UI that kinda work.
- Player is no longer immortal and can die.
